2. My GitHub account username is smmorrow. My profile picture is an image of the GitHub black cat. My account includes all the features available with GitHub’s free version. 
3. The repository I created has the title, “smmorrow.github.io”. My repository manages and stores any changes I make to the program. It’s also saved to one of my local files for easy access.
4. There were multiple steps involved to create a clone of my repository. First, I clicked on the “+” icon and selected “Clone a repository” along with the repository I wanted to clone; in this case “smmorrow.github.io”. Afterwards, I saved a copy to a file path on my computer.
